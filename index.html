					<h2>
					Is there a font that’s been used as successfully as often as Cooper Black
					</h2>
					<p>
					Not many typefaces can represent an era just by being set on a page as well as Cooper Black represents the 1970’s, but its bubbly charm has allowed it to endure for decades in both “high-end” and “low-brow” design applications. Many of us encounter Cooper Black in some form every day, whether it’s on a candy wrapper, a strip mall sign, or an album cover. When I see it used poorly it sticks out like a sore thumb, but how many times have I had to remind myself that Tootsie Roll wrappers use it?
