					<p>This microsite was commissioned by Budweiser to publicise their Marlay Park music festival taking place in August 2007. As well as building the framework, I coded video and audio functionality, made extensive use of Fusekit for programmatic animation and used 		web services to communicate with the Budweiser backend.  This project ran to a very short timescale however I was able to create a solid maintainable site which is still in use and has been updated by other developers since.</p>

					<p>This microsite was commissioned by the Carbon Trust to publicise their innovative Carbon Labelling scheme. I took over the AS2/OOP development of this project just before launch and was required to work to a very tight deadline.  After launch, I reworked the microsite so it was scalable and would allow for the loading in of a variety of  external assets.</p>

					<p>At Victoria Real/Endemol, I worked with a team whose task was to create an  extensive group of Flash websites for the Formula One Williams team.  I was responsible for developing an intuitive navigational interface based on physics and collision detection which will be used on two of the sites.</p>

					<p>At Atticmedia, I was one of the main developers on this BBC Digital Curriculum 7-11 Music project. It took 10 months to develop and was intended to be launched as part of the BBC Jam series.  I worked within a strict AS2 framework and become very familiar with the BBC DC custom component set.</p>

					<p>I was the main developer on this year long project for the Institute of Physics.  The task was to create a set of 5 interactive cds to educate trainee Physics teachers.  I created a generic Actionscript framework that could be used across all 5 cds, with each cd loading in its relevant xml, swf and jpg content.  The Flash framework was loaded into a Director shell which was responsible for writing and reading the users preferences, stored as xml documents, from the users hard drive.</p>

					<p>The Big Match game was one of set of 3 created for the Museum of London.  It is a matching pairs game that allows the user to find out more about each item being matched. The game is part of the Museum of London's 20th Century exhibition.</p>

					<p>No URL at present</p>
					<p>I created this game for Atticmedia, in conjunction with Red Nose Day and McCains.  The Flash front end I worked on hooked into an ASP backend.  The user creates a 'face' for their profile and then via the Flash interface emails a friend to challenge them to one of the 3 games contained within.  High scorers go into the hiscore table and the highest scorer wins an iPod.  This site was only live for approximately two weeks and had a very successful response.</p>
